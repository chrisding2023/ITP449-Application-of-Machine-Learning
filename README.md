# ITP449-Application-of-Machine-Learning
Course Description
From eerily accurate movie recommendations to the selection of inspection-worthy soil and rock samples
on Mars, it is increasingly commonplace to discover machines using data to make critically important
decisions. This course introduces the interdisciplinary field of machine learning which is at the intersection
of computer science, statistics, and business. In this course, students will learn to use Python to acquire,
parse and model data. A significant portion of the course will be a hands-on approach to the fundamental
modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms that enable students to build robust predictive
models of real-world data and test their validity.
Learning Objectives
After completing this course, students will be able to:
• Perform exploratory data analysis using Python
• Build and refine machine learning models to predict patterns from data
• Communicate data-driven insights
